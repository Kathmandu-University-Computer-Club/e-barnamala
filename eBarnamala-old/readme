About:
eBarnamala is written for the primary purpose of learning Nepali in a self paced style. So it should go very well for child learning as well as adult learning. I have tried to add lessons and activities that helps one use Nepali on a day to day basis rather than looked as the complexities of it.

License:
eBarnamala is currently available as executable for windows only. I plan to release it under Linux in the very near future. The reason for the delay is the testing part. The source code to the software will also be released in due course of time.
This software is free to everyone for educational purposes. 

Usage:
To Use it:
- Install it to some folder
- double click on ebarnamala.exe
- You just need to know how to use the mouse
