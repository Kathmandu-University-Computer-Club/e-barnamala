About:
eBarnamala is written for the primary purpose of learning Nepali in a self paced style. So it should go very well for child learning as well as adult learning. I have tried to add lessons and activities that helps one use Nepali on a day to day basis rather than looked as the complexities of it.

License:
eBarnamala is currently available as executable for windows and in source form for Linux.
eBarnamala has been thoroughly tested on winxp and Ubuntu Linux, but not on any other platforms. For these two platforms, operational details are provided 
in the file noteForDevelopers.otl. Before notifying me regarding any bugs please go through that file to check if I have already recorded them there.
This software is free to everyone for educational purposes. 

Installation:
For Windows:
Use the downloaded installer to install.
For Linux:
Python uses the following bindings:
	-- wxPython
	-- PIL
Download and install these two packages using the synatic Package Manager or any other package managers. Then create a .fonts directory in your home directory. Copy the two fonts from the fonts directory within the eBarnamala directory.

Usage:
For Windows just click on the desktop icon or eBarnamala menu from start menu. 
For linux call python eBarnamala.py from the command line while in the eBarnamala folder.
